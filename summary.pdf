Fog computing offers significant advantages by processing data closer to end users, reducing latency, enhancing security, and improving scalability. This technology minimizes data movement, alleviates bandwidth usage, and ensures quick response times, which are crucial for real-time applications. However, challenges such as identifying users during malicious attacks and the complexity involved in tracing potential threats remain concerns. 

The characteristics of fog computing include geographical distribution, low latency, and support for mobility access. Real-world examples, such as the data generated by jet engines, highlight the necessity of fog computing to efficiently handle large data volumes without overwhelming central servers. Acknowledgments are made to the contributions of researchers and foundational works in the field, underscoring the collaborative nature of advancing fog computing technologies.
