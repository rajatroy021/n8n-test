Fog computing provides numerous advantages, including reduced data movement, enhanced security, and improved scalability. By enabling data processing closer to users, it minimizes congestion and ensures quick response times, which is especially beneficial for real-time applications. However, challenges such as user identification during attacks and complex detection processes must also be considered. The framework supports mobility access and efficiently handles the geographical distribution of data processing. Overall, fog computing represents a significant advancement in managing data flow and enhancing system performance.\n\n- Authored by - Xavier
